# HappyMeet - Better Meeting

Improve meetings by making Google Meet more engaging.

With HappyMeet, users can send emojis to other attendees to share emotions or to vote on polls. HappyMeet is used by interactive training courses, such as [C4E|chrislaffra.com/c4e].

HappyMeet sends messages between attendees. Those message do not contain personally identifiable information. The data packages look like this:

    emoji: "âœ…"
    meetingId: "hyh-tjnq-rmd"
    type: "emoji"
    userId: "527033266"

The userId only has meaning during the call.
